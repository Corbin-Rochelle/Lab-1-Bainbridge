\section{Introduction}
Your introduction.  Throughout the document do not forget to include citations.\cite{JJThomson}

\section{Theory}
Your theory section.

\section{Experiment}
A description of the experiment giving details.  You need to include a schematic of the device as well as details on how the measurement was made.

\section{Data Analysis}
Go over the analysis.  You should include plots of the data which will indicate the quality of the data.  The plot should include ``error bars'' and a fit line (not a trend line).  You should include tables of any values which are needed in the analysis but not represented by the information in the figures.

\section{Conclusion}
How does your result compare to the accepted value.  If you are within $2\sigma$ then the result is acceptable.
